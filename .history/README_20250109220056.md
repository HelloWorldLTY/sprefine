# sprefine
Codes for paper: spRefine Denoises and Imputes Spatial Transcriptomics with a Reference-free Framework Powered by Genomic Language Model

## Installation

Please use this code to create an environment for running spRefine:

```
conda env create -n spr -f sprefine.yml
```

Bascially, we only need [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [pytorch_lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning), and [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for training, testing and applications.
